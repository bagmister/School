For my project idea. I wrote a small python program for CSE 111. It's currently written in python and has no ui. I want to add a UI for it and refactor the oil change and tire change functions into javascript and have clickable buttons to add items and save to local storage. Is this something I could do? 
an object for example would be an oil change. it will contain. Location performed, date and current odometer reading.
Tire change would be another. date, location, tires changed from a selectable list with check boxes for the tire changed.

The program is an aid for maintenance for a motorhome. I am making it for myself to organize my data and maintenance I do on my motorhome. It would use objects, arrays, dictionaries, and multiple functions and modules potentially.
