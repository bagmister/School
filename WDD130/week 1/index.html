    <h2>Kevin Bagley</h2>
    <p>I am from UT. I enjoy working on machines and am somewhat of a backyard mechanic. I don't know the name of the degree that I am persuing. I know that it is web development. I am married and have children. I currently am a software developer for work. I like BYU-I because it's cheaper than most. RIght now I only see doors opening for people that still care about degree's. I have been a memeber most of my life of the church. Isaiah 41:10 is my favorite scripture.
